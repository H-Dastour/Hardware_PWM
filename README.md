# Hardware_PWM
- It is a C++ class for controlling 4 PWM channels of a timer.
- It is useful for STM32 microcontroller series, but you can use some functions for other microcontrollers.

- You can add this class to your projects and control PWM channels of a timer easily.

- Also, you can complete it or suggest new ideas till we will have a perfect class.
- I hope it will be useful.
